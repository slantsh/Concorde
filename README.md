## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
  

### Installation and usage
Install PyGame if not present
```bash
pip install pygame
```
Clone the repo and run main.py
```bash
git clone https://github.com/slantsh/Concorde
cd concorde
python main.py

## Limitations as of now

- Cannot use the same chord twice.
- After removing a chord, the next chord becomes the 4th one every time.
- Order of chords is not distinguishable.
- Only one octave for now.
- Generally convoluted code as this was a 12th grade project made in a couple of days.
